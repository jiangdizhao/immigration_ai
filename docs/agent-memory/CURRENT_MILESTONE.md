# CURRENT_MILESTONE

**Milestone:** Phase 11 — Chinese-first Immigration & Study Service Platform UI Rebase  
**Status:** IN PROGRESS  
**Updated:** 2026-09-20

## Objective

Transform the existing production frontend into a Chinese-first immigration/study service platform inspired by the approved temporary V4 product direction, while preserving the main repository's authentication, conversation, legal-answer, VIP, billing, lawyer, safety, evidence and deployment behavior.

## Current active task

Next executable correction:

- `docs/agent-memory/tasks/P11-003C-R2.md`
- title: Home Affairs structured alert discovery + source-specific bounded fetch calibration
- state: PLANNED

## Evidence that triggered R2

A live operator smoke against:

`https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/student-500`

showed:

- HTTP 200 and normal Home Affairs content;
- compressed transfer around 239 KB;
- decoded HTML around 1.43 MB;
- original 128 KB decoded-body cap correctly rejected the response;
- normal same-host anchors provide poor discovery precision;
- the page embeds `siteData` JSON containing structured `alertItems`.

Therefore R2 must not simply enlarge the cap and continue generic link crawling.

## R2 direction

For the configured Home Affairs source:

```text
known allowlisted Home Affairs seed
    ->
bounded decoded-body fetch
    ->
extract <script id="siteData" type="application/json">
    ->
parse bounded siteData.alertItems
    ->
non-public discovery candidates
    ->
human review only
```

The Home Affairs strategy should use no generic link fan-out for policy discovery.

The structured alert record is still raw discovery evidence. In particular, `updateDate` is not automatically a legal effective/commencement date.

## Non-goals

R2 must not:

- publish anything;
- write `MANUAL_POLICY_ENTRIES`;
- add an LLM;
- infer legal status/effect;
- modify legal-service;
- add DB/scheduler infrastructure;
- broaden to arbitrary websites;
- redesign the public Policy Intelligence UI.
