## P11-003B accepted architecture

P11-003B established the required publication boundary:

- `chatbot/content/policy-intelligence/registry.ts` is the server-only editorial registry;
- `chatbot/lib/policy-intelligence-server.ts` owns server-only published loaders;
- `chatbot/lib/policy-intelligence.ts` owns shared types, validation and pure public-projection logic;
- Home, `/intelligence`, and `/intelligence/[id]` load policy data on the server;
- client presentation receives only explicit public-safe projections;
- `origin` and `discovery` metadata are excluded from public projections;
- the Home preview receives an even smaller projection;
- the production editorial registry remains empty;
- the manual Git-based curation workflow is documented under `chatbot/content/policy-intelligence/README.md`.

Validation at the accepted checkpoint:

- unit tests: **169 passed**;
- production build: **passed**;
- changed-file Biome: **passed**;
- `git diff --check`: **passed**;
- repository-wide lint retained the known 22 unrelated diagnostics.

No DB, admin-write API, crawler, scheduler, LLM summariser, legal-service change or automatic publication was added.

## P11-003C + R1 + R2 implementation

P11-003C, its R1 security correction, and R2 structured Home Affairs strategy are pushed at `009e7f964f86bd6b755d4fe5ded82c922ea48f09`. The operator-only discovery path is separate from the public application:

```text
allowlisted official source
    -> bounded secure fetch/parsing
    -> Home Affairs siteData.alertItems or existing generic strategy
    -> policy-intelligence.discovery-candidate.v1
    -> local non-public artifact or dry-run stdout
    -> human verification
    -> manual PolicyEntry/review/publication gate
```

Changed files:

- `chatbot/scripts/policy-intelligence-discovery.ts`: source configuration, R1 secure bounded fetch, Home Affairs structured-alert extraction, redirect/DNS/content-type/size checks, canonicalisation, fingerprints, candidate contract, deduplication, and bounded discovery.
- `chatbot/scripts/policy-discover.ts`: operator CLI with configured source IDs, `--dry-run`, optional ignored local `--write`, synthetic fixture mode, and bounded candidate count.
- `chatbot/lib/policy-intelligence-discovery.test.ts`: deterministic R1 security, structured parser, source-specific limits, candidate-contract, deduplication, registry-boundary, and local-fixture tests.
- `chatbot/scripts/fixtures/policy-intelligence-discovery/`: synthetic Home Affairs `siteData.alertItems`, sitemap, listing, and detail fixtures.
- `chatbot/content/policy-intelligence/README.md`: discovery sources, structured strategy, CLI usage, candidate semantics, limits, and manual promotion workflow.
- `chatbot/package.json`, `chatbot/.gitignore`: operator command and ignored `.local/policy-intelligence-candidates/` output directory.

Configured discovery sources are grounded in the read-only Python authority registry: Home Affairs (`immi.homeaffairs.gov.au`), Federal Register of Legislation (`legislation.gov.au` and `www.legislation.gov.au`), and ART (`art.gov.au` and `www.art.gov.au`). The TypeScript code has no runtime dependency on `legal-service/`.

The candidate contract is `policy-intelligence.discovery-candidate.v1`. It contains acquisition/provenance fields only: source config and authority, canonical URL, title/date when explicitly present, retrieval time, content type, bounded preview, content hash, HTTP metadata, and strategy. It has no `PolicySourceStatus`, AI analysis, bilingual copy, lawyer commentary, editorial status, or publication operation. Optional write output is local-only under `chatbot/.local/policy-intelligence-candidates/`; the public registry remains untouched and empty.

Generic discovery remains hard-bounded at 4 pages, 8 links per page, 10 candidates, 256 KB total decoded response bytes, 128 KB per response, 5 seconds per request, 15 seconds per run, and 3 redirects. Home Affairs uses a one-page structured-alert strategy with a separate 2 MiB decoded response and total-run ceiling, 100 examined alert items, and no link fan-out. One abort deadline covers DNS, redirects, headers, and complete body streaming. Requests are HTTPS-only, exact-host allowlisted, credential/cookie-free, content-type constrained, manually redirected, and DNS-checked against private/local/link-local destinations. There is no arbitrary URL CLI mode, scheduler, runtime write, or LLM call.

CLI fixture validation:

- Earlier P11-003C generic-link fixture validation: `pnpm --silent policy:discover -- --source home-affairs-guidance --fixture synthetic-listing --dry-run --max-candidates 3` exited 0 and emitted 3 candidates before R2 changed the Home Affairs strategy; R2 uses the dedicated structured fixture below.
- `pnpm --silent policy:discover -- --source home-affairs-guidance --fixture synthetic-home-affairs --dry-run --max-candidates 5`: exit 0; emitted 3 structured non-public alert candidates, with duplicate suppression, raw update metadata, and seed fallback provenance.
- `pnpm --silent policy:discover -- --source federal-register-legislation --fixture synthetic-sitemap --dry-run --max-candidates 3`: exit 0; emitted 3 JSON candidates and the corresponding dry-run summary.
- Live Home Affairs smoke: exit 0, runtime **848 ms**, 5 candidates. The titles were `Subclass 186`, `Skills in Demand 482 processing priorities`, `Employer Sponsored Regional 494 processing priorities`, `Discussion Paper: Reforming Australia's Settlement Grants Programs September 2026`, and `Form Banners - SharePoint Migration Project`; all used `home_affairs_site_alerts` and the configured seed URL, with raw `alertUpdateDate` values `19/09/2026 12:03:28 AM`, `19/09/2026 12:03:27 AM`, `19/09/2026 12:03:26 AM`, `11/09/2026 12:01:53 PM`, and `9/09/2026 4:10:38 PM`. These are unverified discovery candidates, not legal conclusions.

Validation:

- `pnpm test:unit`: **183 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped** outside the sandbox; the discovery tests contributed 14 passing tests, including the R1 timeout/mapped-IPv6 cases and R2 structured-alert/limit cases.
- `pnpm build`: **passed**.
- Changed-file Biome: **passed**.
- `git diff --check`: **passed**.
- `pnpm lint`: fails with the repository-wide known **22 existing diagnostics**; the fixture HTML was corrected and changed discovery TypeScript/fixtures pass focused Biome checks.

Security review result: no arbitrary URL fetch path; Home Affairs does not recursively crawl or fetch alert URLs; redirects cannot leave the configured host allowlist; local/private/link-local DNS targets are rejected; decoded response bytes remain bounded; candidate output is ignored/non-public and never imported by public components; discovery cannot modify `MANUAL_POLICY_ENTRIES`; no candidate-to-public function or automatic publication path exists; no model/provider is called; no `legal-service/` file changed.

## P11-003C-R1 security correction

R1 corrected the fetch deadline lifecycle without changing the discovery surface. One abort deadline now starts before DNS safety resolution and remains active through redirect hops, HTTP headers, and bounded response-body streaming. Body reads cancel on abort, and run-level discovery passes the remaining runtime into the request timeout. Deterministic tests prove hanging bodies and delayed DNS cannot bypass the timeout.

The IPv4-mapped IPv6 parser now converts dotted IPv4 tails structurally before applying the existing private/local, link-local, unique-local, loopback, and multicast checks. Tests cover `::ffff:127.0.0.1`, `::ffff:10.0.0.1`, `::ffff:169.254.1.1`, `::ffff:192.168.1.1`, `::1`, `fe80::1`, `fc00::1`, `fd00::1`, and existing IPv4 cases.

R1 changed only `chatbot/scripts/policy-intelligence-discovery.ts` and its focused test file. Source configuration, CLI surface, candidate schema/storage, publication boundary, public UI, database, legal-service, LLM, and scheduler behavior remain unchanged.

No database, scheduler, LLM, legal-service, answer-time retrieval, Fast, Legal Check, Premium, Phase-6, or ReasoningBank behavior changed.

Unresolved uncertainty: the live Home Affairs alert feed includes navigation/operational items alongside policy-like alerts, so future human review may need a separately approved curation rule. R2 intentionally does not infer legal importance, legal effect, or publication status.

Recommended next action: owner/reviewer inspect the uncommitted diff, then manually author any verified `PolicyEntry` only through the existing draft/review/publication workflow; do not promote candidate artifacts automatically.

## Review result

GitHub review of the pushed R3 checkpoint found no remaining blocking defect. No GitHub Actions checks were attached to the commit; acceptance is based on the inspected source/diff plus the recorded local validation and bounded live smoke.

P11-003C is closed. Do not start P11-004 until the project owner explicitly requests it.


## P11-003C-R3 correction

R3 corrected the reviewed Home Affairs provenance defect without adding a discovery surface. P11-003C is VERIFIED at `fa02295675dc4343430ae0a109722141e669bbf9`.

Home Affairs alert URLs are now resolved against `page.finalUrl` before the existing HTTPS, exact-host, canonicalisation, and network-safety boundary runs. Root-relative, same-host absolute, and HTTPS protocol-relative URLs are accepted when safe; malformed, HTTP, and out-of-scope URLs are ignored. Alert URLs remain provenance pointers and are never fetched.

The synthetic Home Affairs fixture now includes relative, same-host absolute, protocol-relative, out-of-scope, missing, and duplicate alert URLs. The candidate metadata field is now `sourceMetadata.urlProvenance` with explicit kinds:

- `alert` — validated alert pointer;
- `seed` — explicit fallback when no safe alert URL exists;
- `fetched_page` — generic listing/sitemap/detail page that was actually fetched.

Changed files for R3:

- `chatbot/scripts/policy-intelligence-discovery.ts`
- `chatbot/lib/policy-intelligence-discovery.test.ts`
- `chatbot/scripts/fixtures/policy-intelligence-discovery/home-affairs.html`
- `chatbot/content/policy-intelligence/README.md`
- `docs/agent-memory/CURRENT_HANDOFF.md`

Validation:

- `pnpm test:unit`: **184 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped** outside the sandbox; all R1/R2 tests remain passing and the focused discovery file contains 15 passing tests.
- `pnpm build`: **passed**.
- Changed-file Biome: **passed**.
- `git diff --check`: **passed**.
- `pnpm lint`: repository-wide known baseline of **22 diagnostics**, with no new discovery-file diagnostics.

R3 live Home Affairs dry-run: exit 0, runtime **787 ms**, 5 candidates. All five exposed specific resolved canonical URLs and `urlProvenance: "alert"` rather than the Student 500 seed:

- `Subclass 186` -> `https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/Visa-subsite/Pages/work/186-employer-nomination-scheme.aspx`
- `Skills in Demand 482 processing priorities` -> `https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/Visa-subsite/Pages/work/skills-in-demand-482-landing.aspx`
- `Employer Sponsored Regional 494 processing priorities` -> `https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/Visa-subsite/Pages/work/494-skilled-employer-regional-landing.aspx`
- `Discussion Paper: Reforming Australia's Settlement Grants Programs September 2026` -> `https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/settlement-services-subsite/Pages/SETS/overview.aspx`
- `Form Banners - SharePoint Migration Project` -> `https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/form-listing/Pages/niv-eoi.aspx`

No alert URL was fetched: the Home Affairs strategy still performs exactly one configured seed fetch, while deterministic tests record that the fetch target list contains only the seed URL. No publication, LLM, database, or `legal-service/` behavior changed.

Known non-blocking observation: the live feed still includes operational/navigation alerts alongside policy-like alerts; R3 intentionally preserves them as raw non-public candidates and performs no legal-importance or publication inference. Any future relevance filtering requires a separately approved task.


## P11-004 activation — 2026-09-24

P11-004 is now the active Phase 11 task. The project owner requested coarser task granularity, so P11-004 is one Task Packet with two internal review stages rather than a family of A/B/C subtasks.

Current code observations that drive the task:

- `chatbot/app/(chat)/ai-workspace/page.tsx` currently wraps the workspace in a large English-only marketing hero.
- `chatbot/components/premium-answer-mode-workspace.tsx` owns server-backed Fast / Legal Check / Premium entitlement hydration but its visible copy is English-only and presented as a separate large card.
- `chatbot/components/immigration-ai-workspace.tsx` already contains real high-value behavior: persistent conversation list/create/reopen, URL `chatId` continuity, legal `matterId`, answer-mode route selection, political-history sanitization, guided intake, citations, compact sources, lawyer-request action, matter snapshot, known facts and source context.
- much of the workspace chrome is still English-only even though the site locale foundation is Chinese-first.
- `handleBookConsultation` is still a placeholder; real scheduling remains P11-007 and must not be invented here.
- the approved V4 workspace reference supports the direction of a dense operational shell with conversation navigation + central chat + context panel, but the main repository remains functional authority.

P11-004 Stage 1 should change presentation/localized copy around the existing controller, not rewrite the working legal/customer flow.

P11-004 Stage 2 will remain inside the same Task Packet and will be triggered only after Stage 1 Git/source review plus owner browser screenshots.

Next executable packet: `docs/agent-memory/tasks/P11-004.md`, Stage 1 only.

## P11-004 Stage 1 implementation — 2026-09-24

**Original implementation scope:** Stage 1 only. This entry records the implementation state at that time; the post-review completion status is recorded below.

The `/ai-workspace` route now reaches the operational workspace shortly after the shared `SiteHeader`. The page-level promotional hero was removed. The answer mode control is a compact bilingual toolbar, and the existing workspace controller is presented as three regions: conversation/history, active consultation, and matter/source/human-service context. At narrower widths, the consultation remains first and the history/context regions flow below it; desktop uses three columns.

Static workspace copy is centralized in `chatbot/lib/workspace-copy.ts` as `Record<SiteLocale, WorkspaceCopy>` and read through the existing `SiteLocaleProvider`. Chinese is the default through the existing site locale. English switching changes workspace chrome, mode labels, history, quick questions, composer, facts, sources, and lawyer-request UI. Assistant answer markdown, research status, guided-intake prompts, and processing progress continue to follow response/question language; site locale does not feed answer requests or choose answer language. Quick questions remain generic, have no outcome guarantees, and still call `submitMessage(question)`.

The presentation changes retain the existing controller paths and payload semantics: conversation list/create/reopen endpoints; URL `chatId` and legal `matterId`; `widgetRouteForAssistantMode(assistantMode)`; server-backed mode access, disabled states and `ASSISTANT_MODE_STORAGE_KEY`; political submission evaluation, `sanitizePoliticalHistory()` and blocked-turn cleanup; current and merged intake facts; persisted assistant message IDs for `LawyerRequestAction`; citations, compact sources, research status, typewriter rendering, progress, errors, auto-scroll and debug output. Stable workspace input/message/send test IDs remain. No backend, schema, scheduling, legal-reasoning, provider, Phase-6, billing, or ReasoningBank work was performed.

The appointment placeholder is labeled as planned and does not claim availability or create a booking. The existing lawyer-review request action remains available with its entitlement check and request payload unchanged. AI confidence is now labeled as an AI signal and explicitly distinguished from lawyer advice/legal certainty.

Changed files:

- `chatbot/app/(chat)/ai-workspace/page.tsx`
- `chatbot/components/consultation-escalation-card.tsx`
- `chatbot/components/guided-intake-card.tsx`
- `chatbot/components/immigration-ai-workspace.tsx`
- `chatbot/components/lawyer-request-action.tsx`
- `chatbot/components/premium-answer-mode-workspace.tsx`
- `chatbot/lib/workspace-copy.ts`
- `chatbot/lib/workspace-copy.test.ts`
- `chatbot/package.json`
- `docs/agent-memory/CURRENT_HANDOFF.md`

The V4 reference was inspected at `jiangdizhao/immigration_temporal_ui@8abbba2d6b94e7fb31048447b9831aaac6a6b029`, including the workspace composition and design system. Its visual direction informed the compact, dense workspace and semantic AI/human distinction. No mock facts, credentials, prototype behavior, or Vite code were copied.

Validation:

- `pnpm test:unit`: **187 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped** (includes 3 workspace-copy tests).
- `pnpm build`: **passed** on the final JSX.
- `pnpm lint`: **failed with the existing 22 repository diagnostics**; no changed-file diagnostics were reported by focused Biome.
- Changed-file `pnpm exec biome check`: **passed** for all changed frontend source, test, and package files.
- `git diff --check`: **passed**.
- Browser smoke: **attempted but blocked before the workspace mounted**. The first guest-auth redirect returned Auth.js `UntrustedHost` for `localhost:3000`; retrying with process-only trusted-host handling entered a redirect loop. No conversation API or answer-provider request was reached, and no screenshot was captured. The answer endpoint had been planned as a stub so no paid provider would be called. Owner screenshots are required before Stage 2.

Known Stage 1 limits / owner review:

- Desktop and mobile visual review has since been completed; the remaining Stage 2 polish scope is recorded below.
- Conversation creation/reopen, mode access states, locale switching and message submission were not exercised because guest authentication did not complete. They were preserved by source inspection and compilation.
- Browser smoke remains blocked before the workspace mounted, as described above; visual review does not change that validation limitation.

## P11-004 Stage 1 completion

**Status:** Stage 1 completed and reviewed.

- Commit: `1e879c0`
- Scope: AI workspace presentation rebase.

Completed:

- Rebased the AI workspace into a Chinese-first immigration service platform style.
- Preserved the existing conversation lifecycle, AI answer flow, matter IDs, lawyer-review workflow, citations, authentication, and backend contracts.
- Added bilingual workspace presentation.
- Removed the misleading confidence progress visualization.
- Clarified the AI confidence signal versus legal certainty.

Validation:

- Unit tests passed.
- Build passed.
- Desktop and mobile visual review completed.

The earlier browser-smoke limitation remains: authentication prevented the workspace from mounting, so conversation and answer routes were not exercised by that smoke.

## P11-004 Stage 2 scope

**Goal:** Polish the mobile consultation experience without changing system behavior.

Planned:

1. Improve mobile lawyer-review visibility.
2. Compact the mobile answer-mode presentation.
3. Replace internal development wording with customer-facing consultation wording.

Constraints:

- No backend changes.
- No API changes.
- No database changes.
- No AI reasoning changes.
- No booking implementation.
